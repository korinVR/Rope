Simple rope simulation for Unity
================================
A simple rope experiment. I connected 80 rigidbodies with Spring Joints and rendered them with Line Renderer using Catmull-Rom spline interpolation.

Just play the Rope scene and drag the rope. Use the up/down arrow keys to wind and unwind the rope.
